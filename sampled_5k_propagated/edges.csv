How about some honesty from you for once?
Its about mental health care. Guns are inanimate objects."

2. A lack of mental health care and access to it is a component of this shooting. *even more crickets*
3. The calls to confiscate guns and more laws restricting our rights has nothing to do with this issue."
1371451533070459904,860547911268139008,"Lets start:
1. This shooting was a hate crime.
2. This shooting was by a transgender.
3. Democrats had two years of a super majority, yet did nothing but play games.
4. A lot of the shooters had obvious needs for mental health care. Access to that is limited."
1371451533070459904,1640929196,"What is not being said is the fact there is a huge lack of access to mental health. Had the transgender had access, this shooting would have been prevented."
1371451533070459904,133938408,"The one unifying issue behind the shootings are being ignored by liberals and others on the left. Its mental health access. Oh, btw, pretty sick trivializing a hate crime perpetuated by the democrats darling demographic, a transgender"
1371451533070459904,939091,"Traitor.
Access to mental health services is whats needed. Not gun control."
1371451533070459904,1915033663,"Republicans nor the NRA pulled the trigger Cupcake!
It was the transgender who committed the hate crime, Cupcake.
The lack of access to mental health services is the problem, cupcake. Exactly what you need cupcake."
1371451533070459904,1915033663,"More lies and showmanship cupcake?
Thats why nothing has been done about the shootings and mental health.

1371451533070459904,1915033663,"Cupcake, finally something we can agree on. Mental health services are so expensive, many cannot afford it. Which likely explains how a transgender, democrat darling, committed a hate crime."
1371451533070459904,967027984426242048,"Its very much at risk. Instead, we should be having a conversation about mental health access and the transgender community."
1371451533070459904,11347122,"McCarthy is correct. There are already laws in place to deal with this. What is cowardly, is the fact that no one is talking about the real problem. The shooting was a hate crime. The shooting was perpetuated by a transgender. We need mental health services."
1371451533070459904,967027984426242048,"Sorry for your loss. But truthfully, we need better mental health services in this country. We need to discuss the hate crime. Outlawing guns from law abiding citizens is not the answer."
1371451533070459904,1344389506963808000,"Calm down cupcake. You are falling for the usual narrative. Lets instead talk about the majority of do nothing over the last two years. A transgender that commited a hate crime. Oh better yet, lack of mental health services. Come at this with your hands clean buttercup!"
1371451533070459904,1915033663,"Let me translate cupcake:
We do not need gun control and all of your nonsese.
We need better mental health services.
Further translation:
A transgender pulled the trigger. Not the gun, not the NRA and not the republicans. The transgender who needed services."

1371451533070459904,1915033663,"Cupcake, we could do that. Its called removing the right to bear arms at the cost of personal protection. So no, cupcake, it would not work. We need mental health funding to stop the hate crimes shooters love to commit."

The number one killer of children is the lack of mental health care."
1371451533070459904,1915033663,Awww cute one Cupcake! Its not the guns. Its the lack of mental health services.
1371451533070459904,1915033663,"Cupcake, its hypocrites such as yourself. 
A transgender murdered these children. 
Likely needed access to mental health services and could not get that.
Its not the guns that committed the hate crime cupcake."
1371451533070459904,133938408,I want to take another moment and recognize the phoney hypocrisy here. Its not the guns. Its the lack of mental health care.
1371451533070459904,1915033663,Awww cupcake! Now go take your pills and calm down. Its mental health access that causes the shootings. Not the guns themselves.

2940107031,2940107031,"Only after a trans person is the shooter, conservative news organizations bring up mental health? So why was this not an issue when all the cis gender men where the shooters?"
2940107031,1344356576786865920,How about every school shooter prior to this one. Maybe if the conservative party would make mental health a priority these thing would not occur...by your own admission you are the problem!

1626962698746629888,991741610718257024,Wondering if it’s a good time to bring up the suicide rate of veterans and how the left could use it the same way some are pointing out mental health in the trans community?

448763508,133938408,Well your study failed because it says 25% are linked to non psyc issues including depression. Depression is a mental health disorder so that study literslly contradicted itself in the first paragraph!!
448763508,133938408,How many of the shootings were ppl with mental health issues relating to gender dysphoria? We will never know because most of the shooters are dead!!
448763508,133938408,Relative to gun ownership the us is actually low compared to some countries with stricter laws. At the end of the day the main issue is mental health. You cannot say a person who chooses to kill another person other than for self defence doesnt have mental health issues
448763508,133938408,If you believe a person chooses to go kill one or more other ppl and there is no mental health issue in every single case then explain how a sane person chooses to go kill one or more ppl.
448763508,133938408,The overall trend is mental health issues! The secondary trend is we have a specific group ie the trans group who have ppl within that group actively asking for violence targeting religious groups. They are posting this online and the other day was the start. Not a gun issue
448763508,133938408,Gender dysphoria is a mental health issue in itself. The inability to take criticism without turning that into violence is a mental health issue! Gender dysphoria is listed as a mental health diagnosis in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5)
448763508,133938408,Fix the mental health issues and the rest will fix itself!
448763508,133938408,Mass shootings are linked to mental health. Not all shootings are linked to mental health! The majority of mass shootings have seen suicide notes or manifestos published! Suicide is a mental health related issue. The manifestos predominanty were based around dillusion!
448763508,133938408,All the mass shootings have had clear links to mental health related issues. Your claiming guns is the issue is like me saying mental health is the issue. Not every person with an MH issue is gonna go on a shooting rampage. Neither are the 160m americans who own guns only 695!!!
448763508,133938408,I have no issue with that. Do good checks. Especially link mental health reports into the checks etc etc.
448763508,133938408,Oh and as per the reports one of the victims father had been providing counseling for them due to their Mental Health Issues!! Boom!
448763508,133938408,Now you are resorting to using the spectrum to define this. As per your article that spectrum shows mass shootings sit within a defined mental health issue spectrum. When I say mental health Im not pushing for the top end of the spectrum. Im covering everything from depression up
448763508,133938408,"If you can show how a person without a mental health issue decides to grab a gun and kill 5+ ppl then you will be right. Until you can show that, it is a mental health issue end of story! There is no way you can twist this into not being a mental health issue"
448763508,133938408,Yet again it literally only talks about serious mental illness like psychosis which ignores mental health like depression etc.
448763508,133938408,Sending a message by mass murder is literally a mental health issue. If you believe your only way to send a message is by mass murder yiu have mental health issues no question about it.
448763508,133938408,The gun control in australia is a similar process as in the US. Certainly some states allow quicker access but funny most of those arent where the shootings occur! Australian gun laws have zero link to a reduction in mass shootings given our mental health stats are far better!
1573042789436489984,1344356576786865920,Or how many countries who ban assault weapons don’t have mass shootings even though they have mental health issues there. Thats the starting point. The AR-15 is the common denominator and os not protected under 2A. Time for it to go.
1250313331883130112,1500129642,Or he just doesn’t like their way of life and speaks out against it since they push to change policy for everyone. It’s that simple. Nobody is insecure about trans people mostly disgusted or concerned for their mental health problems.
1564026266243559936,1268223690480610048,"Actually, that’s when wokeness began &amp; that race baiting bozo, Obama started creating the divide in the US. Semi automatic rifles have always been available. This is a mental health issue completely. More people are killed with hammers in a year than in mass shootings in 5 years."
817035937301597952,1344356576786865920,"So, in your equation, the ease of access isn't a problem? So how do you stop someone with mental health issues from getting a gun used by Rambo to clean out an entire village in Vietnam? Gun rights do not trump human life.. You sick and morals-less beast..."
1576669705443709952,1344356576786865920,I got suspended for agreeing with a tweet that reported on a study concluding that transgenderism is a mental health problem. They said it was hateful speech. I thought Elon Musk cured all this bullshit.
1562123574,1344356576786865920,And here we go.  Now it’s not the guns it’s the trans.  Before it wasnt the guns it was the kids from broken homes.  Then it wasnt the guns it was their mental health.  Know what every iteration has in common…a gun.  Take away the gun and the problem goes away.
1562123574,292929271,Ah only when it’s Christians does  Charlie care.   Only when its a trans person does Charlie care.  When it’s a white man it’s all ‘thoughts and prayers…its not the guns its a mental health issue’.  Apparently in the US white Christian lives still hold more value than others.
553383315,1200228259700649984,"Well that’s unfortunate, don’t worry Mike you have lots of support from people that don’t put a political spin on your efforts &amp; achievements for yourself &amp; helping mental health! Hopefully you can ignore them &amp; consider it noise from horrible selfish people! Keep being you!"
93781120,1969097227,"You don't know what it's likely to show- maybe a domestic terrorist, maybe someone with significant mental health issues, maybe something else entirely.  I agree we should see the note, but spare us the lecture about anti-Christian terrorists until we know more."
230422129,230422129,Michael Matheson was not very good when he was minister for mental health so he will be no good as the new Scottish health secretary
230422129,230422129,Fractured unpleasant Dumbarton society. Silverton &amp; Overtoun Community Council have banned me for a few months. Dumbarton East have refused our proposed merger. SNP councillors did not turn up for Labour mental health talk.
788882806449572992,1500129642,"Me looking at the last 10 mass shootings and wondering why 4 of them were trans but onyl represent less than 1% of the entire population. You'd think someone would say ""hmmm I think there's a problem with the mental health of this group"""
937899468585827968,1367531,"School safety officers makes sense. You know what else makes sense? Red flag laws, mental health personnel at schools and restrictions on kids under 21 having access to assault style weapons. Why cant we do all these??"
1326004511199030016,1344356576786865920,"You cite mental illness in the kids, yet you vote against mental health help for them in schools. “Stop blaming guns” is your retort, how bout doing what is best for the children rather than doing the right thing for them! School shootings are the number one cause of kids deaths."
