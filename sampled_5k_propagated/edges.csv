142645394,56561449,"on the gender-affirming fad going on, I feel it's time the parents of these children/minors undergo a mental health evaluation along with the child. To make sure it's not the parent preferring to raise a boy opposed to a girl or vice versa. Ensuring no influence"
1504180543679699968,133938408,"Oh, is this a representative or spokesperson for the NRA? We need mental health reform (involuntary institution) and armed guards as well as police being allowed to do their jobs without the lefties coming in and criminalizing them for enforcing the law."

1520497215445339904,133938408,I think most Americans who own guns do care a great deal about the health and safety of our fellow citizens. AR type weapons often help in that regard. I'm all in on mental health support and addtnl services and training for gun owners - not gun restrictions.

448763508,133938408,Relative to gun ownership the us is actually low compared to some countries with stricter laws. At the end of the day the main issue is mental health. You cannot say a person who chooses to kill another person other than for self defence doesnt have mental health issues
